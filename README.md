# Codenlighter

#### The idea for this framework came with the purpose of being able to build, customize and 
#### modify all the libraries and solutions of a framework.
#### You can thus modify all the libraries, even the whole structure the way it pleases you.
#### If you want to contribute to this project, please do not hesitate to contact me,
#### this framework is still at development stage. We still have a lot to do before 
#### being able to say that this framework is functional!
